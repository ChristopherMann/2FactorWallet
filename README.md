2FactorWallet
=============

The prototype of a bitcoin wallet with two-factor authentication and verification over a seperate channel. This prototype uses a modified version of the two-party DSA signature protocol by MacKenzie and Reiter.

Further information can be found in the article _Two-factor authentication for the bitcoin protocol_ by Christopher Mann and Daniel Loebenberger (https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/629.pdf).

**This is a prototype. Do NOT use it for storing your real Bitcoins.**
